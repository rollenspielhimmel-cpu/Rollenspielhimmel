/**
 * A session *and* a verified email address — both, deliberately, and this is why the pair is
 * not split into two composable middlewares: a route that listed only the first half would
 * fail *open*, and there are sixty chances to make that mistake. Authorization composes on top
 * of this; authentication does not decompose below it.
 *
 * This is the default for every route: gating had
 * to be the thing you get by not thinking about it, because the alternative was adding a
 * second middleware to thirty-three files and every omission being a silent hole.
 *
 * 403 rather than 401: the session is perfectly good, so answering "unauthorised" would send
 * the client back to the sign-in page it just came from. The error names the reason, which is
 * what the interface reads to show the verification wall.
