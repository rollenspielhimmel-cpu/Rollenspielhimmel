/**
 * Who may reach the Blind-Date desk.
 *
 * Three things are worth holding in place, and each of them is the kind that breaks quietly.
 *
 * **Every route of the area, not four of five.** The list below is the whole desk, and a route added
 * later that forgets the guard would be a hole nobody sees — the queue is the obvious one to
 * protect and the participation table is the one that gets forgotten.
 *
 * **The suspension is derived**, so it cannot be left switched on. A manager who applies goes blind
 * to the desk; when the application is settled, the access is simply there again, with nothing to
 * clear.
 *
 * **Nobody pairs themselves**, and that one has no exemption at all — not even the root
 * administrator, who is exempt from the suspension so the desk keeps working while somebody waits.
