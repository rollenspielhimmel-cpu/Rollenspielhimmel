 * The one definition of an acceptable email address. Every route that takes one uses this,

 * *stricter* than the browser's, so an address the form accepted would be refused by the API
 * with no explanation the member could act on.
 *
 * The HTML5 pattern is what browsers apply to `input[type=email]`, so the form and the schema
 * agree exactly. It is deliberately permissive — `a@b` and `alice@localhost` pass — which is
 * the price of that agreement.
 *
 * Lower-cased on the way in, so the UNIQUE constraint cannot be sidestepped by changing case.

 * what the interface will not send.
 *
 * A pattern rather than a `.trim()` transform. Normalisation belongs in the service, where a
 * caller cannot skip it, and a transform in a request schema reaches `open-api.json` as a shape
 * the client cannot see — where `pattern` is a rule the document can state plainly.

/**
 * The story vocabularies — genres, subgenres, tropes, content warnings. Chosen from the database's
 * own enums rather than typed, which is what makes them filterable: „Enemies to Lovers" and
 * „enemies-to-lovers" were three tropes to a query and one to a reader.
 *
 * Optional rather than defaulted to empty. A default materialises the field even when the
 * client omitted it, which on a PATCH means every partial update silently clears the tags —
 * a test caught exactly that. Absent has to mean "unchanged"; the column defaults to empty
 * for a create.
 *
 * A repeat is refused rather than dropped. The values are closed, so sending one twice is a
 * client bug and nothing else — silently de-duplicating it would hide the bug and answer 200 to a
 * request the sender got wrong. The issue names the value and the position, like every other
 * field error here.
 *
 * **The `superRefine` and the `meta` are a pair.** A refinement does not reach `open-api.json` on
 * its own, which is why the report body is a union rather than a refine; `uniqueItems` is the one
 * JSON Schema word for this rule, so declaring it keeps the document honest. Drop either and the
 * two disagree — the specification would promise a rule nothing enforces, or hide one that bites.
