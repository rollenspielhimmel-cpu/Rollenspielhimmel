-- The lifecycle, and only that. `resolved` and `dismissed` were two closings here once, but what
-- separated them is said far more precisely by `report_outcome`, so closing is one state and the
-- outcome carries which kind of closing it was. `in_progress` is a report in somebody's hands,
-- which is what stops two operators judging the same case.
--
-- Nothing ever writes this: `report.status` is a generated column over the two timestamps below,
-- so the type exists for what reads a report rather than for what stores one.
CREATE TYPE public.report_status AS ENUM ('open', 'in_progress', 'closed');

-- How a closing turned out, which is what `resolved` and `dismissed` used to say between them and
-- says it finely enough to be worth reading. Declared in full here for the same reason every
-- other enum in this schema is.
--
-- Upheld first, refused after, `other` last, like `report_category`'s order — but note this only
-- holds inside Postgres, which sorts an enum by declaration. `kysely-codegen` sorts these
-- alphabetically on the way out, so the order an operator actually reads is the frontend's own
-- list in `lib/format/report.ts`, exactly as it already is for the categories.
--
-- Two of these exist for this platform in particular. `content_warning_added` is what a
-- `missing_content_warning` report is usually answered with, so the answer names the same thing
-- the complaint did. And `target_gone` is a closing the queue can already see coming, since it
-- knows whether the reported thing still exists.
--
-- Whether an outcome upheld or refused the report is not a column of its own: nothing filters on
-- that yet, and it is recoverable from the value if anything ever does.

-- lists all four of its own.
--
-- Two of these exist because this is a *fiction* platform with content warnings, which is what
-- makes the usual list from elsewhere a poor fit. Violence and sexual content are legitimate
-- subject matter here; what is reportable is that they were not declared, hence
-- `missing_content_warning`. And `plagiarism` is one of the likeliest real reports on a site
-- where people publish prose, and appears on nobody else's list.

-- One report per member per thing **per category**, which is the line between correcting a report

-- indistinguishable: a member who reported a post as harassment and then noticed it was also
-- plagiarism had the first claim silently overwritten by the second. Filing the same category
-- twice is the slip, and that still rewrites the reason.
--
-- A second member reporting the same thing is a different row either way, which is the count an
-- operator wants. A closed report does not block reporting the same thing again, if it happens
-- again. The bound on one member and one thing is therefore the size of `report_category`.
--
-- `closed_at IS NULL` rather than `status = 'open'`, because a report being worked on has to go on
-- blocking duplicates: while this asked for `open`, taking a report dropped it out of the index and
-- quietly let the same member file it again. It reads the timestamp rather than the generated
-- `status` because a partial index cannot have a generated column in its predicate.
-- `insertReport`'s ON CONFLICT clause restates this whole predicate, and Postgres refuses the
-- insert outright the moment the two disagree.
--
-- Three things this needs, and the last two exist because SET NULL can rewrite an indexed
-- column long after the row was written.
--
-- NULLS NOT DISTINCT, because six of the seven target columns are always NULL and Postgres
-- would otherwise treat every row as unique.
--
-- `reporter_id IS NOT NULL`, or two reports of the same thing by two different members collide
-- the moment both reporters delete their accounts — and the collision fails the *deletion*, so
-- a member could be unable to leave because somebody else reported the same thing they did.
--
-- `num_nonnulls(...) = 1` for the mirror of that on the other side: deleting a second reported
-- post would null that row's last target column and collide with the first all-NULL row.
--
-- Both predicates say the same thing in the end: this index is about live members reporting
-- things that still exist, which is the only situation in which filing twice is possible.
