-- One member marking one thing. No `target_type` column, unlike `report` and `notification`:
-- these references CASCADE, so exactly one stays non-null for the row's life and the kind is
-- readable off the data. A sixth kind is then a column and nothing else.
--
-- No `updated_at`: a favourite exists or it does not.

-- One favourite per member per thing. NULLS NOT DISTINCT because four of the five references are

-- no reference that can empty under it.
--
-- It is also what every list looks a favourite up through, since `user_id` leads it: each list
-- joins on its own column and the member's id. Leading with `user_id` is what makes it useless for
-- the cascade, which is why the per-kind indexes below exist.
