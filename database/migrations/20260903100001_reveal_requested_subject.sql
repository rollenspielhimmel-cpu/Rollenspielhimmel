-- migrate:up

-- The branch the type added in the previous migration needs. `notification_subject_matches_type`
-- ends in `ELSE false`, so without this every attempt to write one is rejected — which is the
-- constraint working, and the second time it has caught exactly this.
--
-- A reveal request names its group and nothing else, like the match that made it.
