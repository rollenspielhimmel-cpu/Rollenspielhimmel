-- migrate:up

-- `notification_subject_matches_type` ends in `ELSE false`, so the type added in the previous
-- migration is rejected until it has a branch here. That is the constraint working exactly as its
-- own comment says it should — "a new type with no branch here forces the decision" — and this is
-- the decision.
--
-- A Blind-Date match names its group and nothing else. The group's title is the plot, which is
-- what the sentence needs; there is no thread to point at yet, no post, and no chat.
--
-- Rebuilt rather than amended: a CHECK cannot be altered in place.
