 * The type scale, which tailwind-merge cannot infer. It reads `text-*` and guesses: a t-shirt
 * size is a size, anything else is a colour — so it filed `text-note` under colour, and
 * `cn('text-note text-ink-5', …)` merged the two into `text-ink-5` and silently dropped the
 * size. Named sizes have to be declared for the guess to come out right.
 *
 * Kept in step with theme.css by a test, since a new size that is not listed here fails the
 * same silent way.
