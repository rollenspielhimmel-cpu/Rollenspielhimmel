/**
 * The primary destinations, shared by the top bar and the bottom bar so the two cannot
 * disagree about which one a page belongs to — they did once, over `/groups/discover`.
 *
 * **Every destination navigates**, which `name` being required is what enforces. There used to be
 * an optional `children` that opened a menu instead, and members reported it as a click they
 * should not have to make: every resource here has one view people open far more often than the
 * rest, so the bar goes straight there and the alternatives are a strip on the page itself. The
 * menu shape is in the history if it is ever genuinely wanted back.
