 * One block of either rail. Collapsible where the rail exists as a rail, plain where it does
 * not: in the mobile sheet the blocks are simply stacked, because a sheet the member opened on
 * purpose is not the thing that was distracting them.
 *
 * Closed to start, and the choice is not remembered — the rail is reference material a member
 * reaches for, not a workspace to arrange.
 *
 * One accordion per block rather than one holding all three, so several can stand open at once
 * without the views having to wrap them. Only the rail's sizing is set on the trigger; the
 * disclosure chevrons come from the patched component.
 *
 * `meta` is the one number a closed block may still show — „3 offen" beside Nächste Schritte,
 * which is what says whether opening it is worth it.
