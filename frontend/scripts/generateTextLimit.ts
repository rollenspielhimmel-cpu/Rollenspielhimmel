// Emits src/api/textLimit.ts from the OpenAPI document, so the interface enforces the same

//
// The numbers originate in backend/src/text_limit.ts, travel through the Zod request schemas
// into open-api.json, and land here. Orval already carries them across but writes them as
// JSDoc comments, which nothing can read at runtime.
//
// Output goes into src/api/, which is gitignored: the file is rebuilt from the document on
// every generation and never committed, so it cannot go stale.
//
// Run by Node's own type stripping — no build step and no runner. That erases types without
// checking them, so `tsconfig.node.json` covers this file for `vue-tsc --build`, and its
// `erasableSyntaxOnly` rejects the syntax stripping cannot handle (enum, namespace,
// parameter properties) at check time rather than at run time.
